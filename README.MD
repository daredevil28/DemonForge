# Demon Forge; A Drums Rock Editor

A custom song editor for Drums Rock that currently is more of a visualizer than an editor

# Installation

Download the .exe from releases and run it, no further configuration required

# Usage

1. Load your existing .csv file in File > Load File
2. Set the location of the song file in Properties > Song Properties
3. You can now play and see how the song works out

# Future features

- [x] Visualise the notes in sync with the music
- [x] Save charts in a custom json format
- [x] Read the original game format (.csv)
- [ ] Editing charts inside the application
- [ ] Figure out how to properly play sound for drum rolls
- [ ] Snap editing
- [x] Adjustable client settings (scroll speed, note size,volume etc)

- [ ] Undo/Redo button

# Possible future features

* Dynamic BPM changes
* Drum track seperation with something like [OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino)

# Contributing

Other than fixing some bugs I am currently not accepting contributions until I at least finish the editing part of the application
